| [02-01](https://github.com/syeel/240448/blob/master/src/main/java/Week02_01/CountTo10500.java) | You are required to create a simple program for counting thread. It will count to 10500, pausing five seconds between each number, and displaying a string every 50 numbers.|
| [02-02](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week02_02)| You are required to create a program by using TWO (2) threads. The first thread will display integer numbers 1 to 10 and the second thread will display ‘A’ character ten times. The ‘A’ characters will be displayed after number 5 and number 6,7,8,9,10 will be displayed after all As have been printed.|
| [04-01](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week04_01)| Write a java program using Netbeans IDE to compile and run HelloWorld.java stored in folder 'STIW3054' on Desktop.|
| [05-01](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_01)| Modify [TestSleep2.java](https://github.com/zhamri/STIW3054-RT-Programming/blob/master/src/Week_04/TestSleep2.java) to display ONE, TWO, THREE in correct sequence. |
| [05-02](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_02)| [TestAtomicInteger1p.java](https://github.com/zhamri/STIW3054-RT-Programming/blob/master/src/Week_05/TestAtomicInteger1p.java) failed to produce the correct result. Modify TestAtomicInteger1p.java to display "Count=10".|
| [05-03](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_03)| Write a program to compare execution times between normal thread and synchronized thread. The results should be displayed in 'second'.|
| [05-04](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_04)| Write a program to find a maximum number in a list of 1,000,000 random numbers using sequential program and concurrent program. Then compare the execution times for both approaches. The results should be displayed in 'second'.|
| [05-05](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_05)| Write a Java program to find Mean, Mode, and Median in a list of 1,000,000 random numbers using THREE (3) threads (excluding the main thread).|
| [05-06](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week05_06)| Write a Java program to generate 1,000 random numbers between 500 and 3,000. These random numbers will represent the waiting times of each execution in TWO (2) threads. If the total values of Thread-1 greater than the total values of Thread-2, the following number will be incremented by Thread-2. Finally, count the total numbers executed by each thread.|
| [06-01](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week06_01)| Write a Java program to generate 1,000,000 random numbers between 0 and 100. Every random number will be displayed in a chart every 0.5 seconds.|
| [07-01](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_01)| Write a Java program to insert the dependency codes into the pom.xml file.|
| [07-02](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_02)| Write a Java program to search and count 'class' files (example: Xyz.class) in a specific directory/folder. Then display all the class files. Please consider the sub-directories as well.|
| [07-03](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_03)| Write a Java program to search and count repositories in "https://github.com/zhamri". Then display all the repositories.|
| [07-04](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_04)|Write a Java program to search and count contents in "https://github.com/zhamri/STIW3054-RT-Programming" repository. Then display all the contents.|
| [07-05](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_05)|Write a Java program to search and count issues in "https://github.com/zhamri". Then display all the issues.|
| [07-06](https://github.com/syeel/240448/tree/master/src/main/java/Week07_06)|Write a Java program to search and count all contributors in "https://github.com/zhamri" issues. Then display the list of contributors (using github id) and the total number of contributions for each contributor.|
